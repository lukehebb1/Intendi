Intendi is a web application built for a variety of supported web browsers. The application
aims to help lecturers improve and create more engaging course material by receiving
honest, anonymous feedback from students and examining what seemed to engage them
and what they did not find of any interest. It will also aid in giving the lecturer ideas of when
best to upload lectures and know what topics students may be having difficulty
understanding. This will allow students to access more exciting and engaging content and
create a much more in-depth learning environment.
The lecturer receives highly beneficial feedback from students through our web application
that uses AWS Rekognition image processing to analyse their faces while watching the
lecture videos, provided they have given permission. Our facial analysis process extracts
valuable details such as estimated emotion, eye position, facial landmark direction and other
useful facial features. Other data extraction includes determining when students are
watching, if they are on the video player window, and if the volume is not muted. With all this,
we use our own concentration algorithm to provide an estimated concentration level of the
student.
Students' identities are kept completely anonymous. This application also takes away the
need for the end of module feedback forms which, more often than not, are ignored by
students. Instead, with the use of our web application, students can go about their regular
college days of watching lectures whilst also providing critical feedback to their lecturer. This
leads to lecturers receiving much more frequent feedback and also feedback for specific
videos or topics.
Students can securely sign up with a valid DCU email address and log on to the web
application and then join modules they are taking once provided with the module code and
password from the lecturer. Once they join a module, they will see course videos that they
can then watch. When they click on a video, they are prompted to provide permission for
their webcam to capture. Once they accept and press the play button, the facial analysis will
begin. The images are then analysed and the data is extracted. This is then reported to the
relevant lecturer via the report page to see as anonymised data. The report page features
different bar charts and graphs that generate a rich feedback report.
